# Challenge Summary
- Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).

## Challenge Description
- define a method call zip_list which takes two linked list an a arguments.
- zip the two linked lists togather into one.
- so that the nodes alterenatve between the two lists &  return a reference to the head of the zipped list 

- input:-list1 head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X
        -list2 head -> [5] -> [9] -> [4] -> X
- output (returns):- head -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [9] -> [2] -> [4] -> X
