# linked list -Challenge Summary

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
- need to create a class for the Linked List. This class will contain the methods to insert.
-  insert an item in a single linked list is to add an item at the start of the list. 

## linked list  -Challenge Description
- Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
- Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"


# ll-insertions-branch Challenge Summary
- .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
- .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## ll-insertions-branch Challenge Description
- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list

# ll-kth-from-end-branch Challenge Summary
- Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# ll-kth-from-end-branch Challenge Description

- Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
- Where k and the length of the list are the same
- Where k is not a positive integer
- Where the linked list is of a size 1
- “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list
