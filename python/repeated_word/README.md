# Challenge Summary

- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.

- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Challenge Description for Stack class

- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

## Time and Space Complexity of selection sort

- Time complexity Big O(1) 
- space comlexity Big O(1)
